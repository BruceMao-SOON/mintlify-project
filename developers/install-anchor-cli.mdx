**Anchor** is a popular framework for developing Solana programs, leveraging Rust macros to make the process simpler and more efficient.

There are two main ways to install the Anchor CLI and related tools:

1. **Using Anchor Version Manager (AVM)** – **Recommended**: AVM simplifies the process of installing and managing different Anchor versions, making updates easier in the future. We will present this way step by step.
2. **Without AVM** – A more manual method that makes version updates less convenient.

The **AVM** allows you to easily install, switch between, and update different versions of Anchor on your system. Install AVM with the following command:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor avm --force
```

Test the installation to ensure AVM is correctly installed and accessible:

```bash
avm --version
```

Install the latest version of the Anchor CLI using AVM:

```bash
avm install latest
avm use latest
```

If you want to install a specific version, replace `latest` with the version number:

```bash
avm install 0.29.1
avm use 0.29.1
```

Don’t forget to run the `avm use` command to declare which version of the Anchor CLI should be used on your system.

Verify the installation was successful by checking the Anchor CLI version:

```bash
anchor --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
anchor-cli 0.30.1
```

### Common Errors

* **Rust Version Error (`Box<_>` type annotation error)**: If you encounter the following error during installation:

```bash
error[E0282]: type annotations needed for `Box<_>`
```

This error can occur with certain versions of Rust. To resolve this, switch to Rust version `1.79.0` and try the installation again:

* **Permission Denied (Linux/WSL linker error)**: When installing Anchor CLI on **Linux** or **WSL**, you may encounter this error:

```bash
rustup default 1.79.0
```
