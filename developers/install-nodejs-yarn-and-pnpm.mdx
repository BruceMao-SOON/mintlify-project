In order to run the default Anchor project test file, which is written in **TypeScript**, you will need **Node.js** and **Yarn**. By default, when you create a new Anchor project using the `anchor init` command, it generates a TypeScript-based test suite. Alternatively, if you prefer a Rust-based test setup, you can specify it during initialization with `anchor init --test-template rust`.

#### Node.js Installation

The recommended method for installing **Node.js** is by using the **Node Version Manager (nvm)**. This allows you to manage different Node.js versions easily, which is especially helpful when working on multiple projects with different Node.js version requirements.

1.  Install **nvm** by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash
    ```
2. After the installation, restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.
3.  Verify that `nvm` was installed correctly by running:

    ```bash
    command -v nvm
    ```
4.  Once `nvm` is confirmed to be installed, use it to install the latest version of Node.js by running:

    ```bash
    nvm install node
    ```
5.  Verify the Node.js installation by checking the version:

    ```bash
    node --version
    ```
6.  You should see output similar to:

    ```bash
    v22.9.0
    ```

#### Yarn and pnpm Installation

Once Node.js is installed, the next step is to install **Yarn**, which is a package manager commonly used with JavaScript and TypeScript projects. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

You can verify that Yarn was successfully installed by checking its version:

```bash
yarn --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
1.22.22
```

You can install pnpm by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

You can verify that pnpm was successfully installed by checking its version:

```bash
pnpm --version
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
9.11.0
```
