Solana programs are primarily written in the **Rust.** This guide will focus on setting up Rust.

Rust's recommended installation method is **Rustup**, which manages Rust versions and associated tools.

To install Rust, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh -s -- -y
```

This command downloads and installs Rust along with rustup. Once the installation is complete, verify that Rust has been installed correctly by checking the version:

```bash
rustc --version
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```bash
rustc 1.81.0 (eeb90cda1 2024-09-04)
```

At this point, Rust is successfully installed.
