The **Solana Command-Line Interface (CLI)** provides the necessary tools to build, deploy, and interact with Solana programs on the blockchain. It is an essential tool for any Solana developer.

To install the Solana CLI, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.anza.xyz/stable/install)"
```

You can replace the `stable` keyword with a specific release version if you need a particular version, for example, `v2.0.3`. Alternatively, you can choose from one of the three symbolic channel names:

* **stable**: The latest stable release.
* **beta**: Pre-release version with newer features.
* **edge**: The latest but potentially unstable features.

If this is your first time installing the Solana CLI, you may be prompted to add a **PATH** environment variable. After installation, you can either close and reopen your terminal or run the following command to update the path in your existing session:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
```

At this stage, Solana CLI should be fully installed and ready for use. You can confirm the installation by running:

```bash
solana --version
```

During the installation of SOON CLI, you may need to install the GCC compiler toolchain as well.

Use the following command to install

```bash
sudo apt install gcc
```

Use the following command to check installation.

```bash
gcc --version
```
