If this is your first time using the **Solana CLI**, you will need to generate a new key pair. This key pair will serve as your identity when interacting with the **SOON Testnet**. To generate a new keypair, run the following command:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

You should see output similar to:

```bash
Generating a new keypair

For added security, enter a BIP39 passphrase

NOTE! This passphrase improves security of the recovery seed phrase NOT the
keypair file itself, which is stored as insecure plain text

BIP39 Passphrase (empty for none):

Wrote new keypair to /home/xxxxx
============================================================================
pubkey: AEG18Z4ESnzEh1rcgUHk1dLwVY4LyfZ6TWzgShGry5UN
============================================================================
Save this seed phrase and your BIP39 passphrase to recover your new keypair:

#### Important Security Considerations

* **Private Key Security**: The private key in your keypair should **never be shared** or exposed. It grants access to your account and the ability to sign transactions on your behalf. Always keep this file secure.
* **Public Key**: The public key, derived from the keypair, will serve as your wallet address and can be shared with others to receive funds or interact with contracts.
