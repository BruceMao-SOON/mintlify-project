# Set Up the Development Environment

Before writing code, the first step is to set up your development environment. Proper configuration ensures that all necessary tools and dependencies are in place, allowing you to build and deploy programs efficiently.

#### Required Tools

This guide covers the installation of the following tools:

* **Rust**: The main language for Solana programs.

* **Solana CLI**: Required to build, test, and deploy programs.

* **Anchor CLI (Recommended)**: Simplifies Solana program development.

* **Node.js and Yarn:** Required to run the node project.

If you already have these tools installed, skip to the **SOON RPC configuration** section.
