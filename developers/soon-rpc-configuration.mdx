Now that you've set up your development environment, it's time to configure the **RPC** endpoint. This is crucial because it allows your development environment to interact with a specific Solana cluster. In this case, you will be connecting to the **SOON Testnet** rather than the Solana local cluster or default Solana Testnet.&#x20;

#### Configuring the Solana CLI to Use SOON Testnet&#x20;

Instead of pointing your Solana CLI to the default local cluster or Solana Testnet, youâ€™ll need to configure it to use the **SOON Testnet RPC**.

RPC Link: [https://rpc.testnet.soo.network/rpc](https://rpc.testnet.soo.network/rpc)

Run the following command to set the RPC URL to SOON Testnet:

```bash
solana config set --url https://rpc.testnet.soo.network/rpc
```

You can verify that the Solana CLI is properly configured to use the SOON Testnet by running:

```bash
solana config get
```

You should see an output that includes the following URL:

```bash
Config File: /home/xxxx
RPC URL: https://rpc.testnet.soo.network/rpc
WebSocket URL: wss://rpc.testnet.soo.network/rpc (computed)
Keypair Path: /home/xxxxx
Commitment: confirmed
```
